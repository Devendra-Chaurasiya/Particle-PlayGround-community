# 🌌 Particle Playground - Community Presets

Welcome to the **Community Presets** repository! This is the official hub for sharing and discovering custom particle effects created with Particle Playground.

## 🚀 How to Submit a Preset

Contributing your own cool effects is easy! We use **GitHub Issues** as our database to keep things simple and accessible.

1.  **Design your effect** in the [Particle Playground App](https://particle-play-ground.vercel.app/).
2.  Click the **"Submit to Community"** button in the sidebar.
    *   *This will automatically copy your preset data and open a new Issue form for you.*
3.  **Paste** the copied content into the Issue description.
4.  **Add a Title** for your preset.
5.  Click **Submit New Issue**.

Once submitted, your preset joins the community collection where others can find inspiration or import your code!

## 📦 How it Works

*   **No Database:** We don't store files. Your preset code lives directly in the Issue body.
*   **Copy & Paste:** The easiest way to share complex configurations without file uploads.
*   **Open Source:** All submissions are visible to everyone.

## 🛠️ Usage

To use a preset found here:
1.  Open an Issue that looks interesting.
2.  Look for the **Design Code** section.
3.  Copy the code block.
4.  Use it in your own React project!
